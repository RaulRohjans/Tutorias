This was a project I developed in school. Its objective is to allow the management of students, tutors and tutoring sessions. It has 2 platforms, one web and one desktop, both have the same functions and are very similar in functionality, though the web version is the more appealing physically.

This project is mostly finished but it still has some problems, like there are a few funcions on the web part that dont work properly, some date verifications have to be inverted, and only students are able to rate tutoring session, teachers are not supposed to do so.
